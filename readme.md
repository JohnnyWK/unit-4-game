THE CRYSTAL GAME

The Crystal Game is a simple click game that has the user doing math in order to win.  You are given 4 crystals to click on, each having a hidden, randomly generated value between 1 and 12.  The user is also given a number to match by adding up these hidden values equal to the winning number.  Your score is displayed as you click, allowing the user to figure out what each crystals worth is.  Wins are awarded for exact matching values, and losses are given out when you exceed the value given to you.  The wins and losses are recorded on screen until the user navigates away from or refreshes the page.
